This week you will implement your own data science utilities. Let's call it 
polar_cubs or pc for short. It will live in a separate file polar_cubs.py and 
you will be able to use it in your final project. To use it, just place it in 
the same folder as the current file an import it like I do below. 

This will help you a lot in your final project.

In polar_cubs.py there are a few functions already. You can use them.
Additionally, polar_cubs.py contains unfinished functions with docstrings and 
some skeleton code. 

Like in previous weeks, your objective is to complete these functions.
Unlike in previous weeks, these functions will stay in polar_cubs.py. This 
file (assignment10.py), contains 
1) basic tests to ensure your code works (you will use it for testing)
2) one basic exercise at the very end to get you comfortable calling your 
functions from polar_cubs.py. It is very easy.

The groupify() and groupby() functions can be pretty hard. I recommend one or 
two most experienced team members focus on them, while less experienced 
programmers focus on describe(). You can share code once done.


In summary:
(Please read the above before reading the summary.)
- Go to polar_cubs.py and write the first first function.
- Run this file (assignment10.py) to test it.
- When it working, write the next function. 
- Decide who on your team writes groupify() and groupby() and who write 
describe(). You can share code once done.

Finally, 
- work as a team and help each other out,
- feel free to reuse any of the code *you* wrote for DS2000 homework and DS2001 
assignments.

Good luck!
